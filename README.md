# R290
R290 Thermodynamic Model of a Chiller

The current model refrigerant for commercial and domestic is R32.

1 kg of R32 is equivalent to 675kg of CO2, another way of saying this is R32 GWP = 675

This is much better than R410a, the previous generation with a GWP ~ 2000!

R290, or Propane has a GWP = 3!

This is why I’m interested in it, it is also slightly more efficient than R32.

R290/Propane is also flammable and explosive, so the gas should not be able to enter the building.
This is why I’m using a tried and true chiller design, proven in industry. 

These calculation is to see if an R290 chiller can compete with R32 DX unit.

There are new refrigerants out there of the R1234xx series, these are expensive right now, so R290 is still relevant.

This is all a work in progress and by no means complete.
